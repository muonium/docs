For every request, you must send it with raw body, in JSON format. The server will return a JSON based on this model:

**Default response**
```
{
	"code": 400,
	"status": "error",
	"data": {

	},
	"message": null,
	"token": null
}
```
Response code is set on HTTP status code and in response JSON.

Status can be 'error' or 'success'

Token contains a valid token generated by the server for a logged user. The client has to check it every time if different of null because a new one can be generated when expiration is soon.

**We recommend using sessionStorage to store token on the client.**

For every request that needs a logged user, client has to send the last token returned by server in Header Authorization: Bearer.

**If response message is 'removeToken', token has to be removed from client.**

You can have the 'Default reponse' (error 400) for any request due to a bad request or when something went wrong.
If a token is required and you send an empty/invalid token, you will get a 401 error.
